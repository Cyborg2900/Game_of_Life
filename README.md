# Basic Game of Life Web Application

Welcome to the Basic Game of Life Web Application! This project is a simple implementation of John Horton Conway's "Game of Life" using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Game of Life is a cellular automaton that follows a set of simple rules to simulate the evolution of cells on a grid.

## About the Game of Life

The Game of Life is a zero-player game, meaning its evolution is determined by its initial state, with no further input required. The "cells" in this game can be in one of two states: alive or dead. The evolution of the cells happens in discrete time steps, following these rules:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

## Project Details

This web application provides a user interface to interact with the Game of Life simulation. Users can set the initial state of the grid by toggling cells on or off and then start the simulation to watch the cells evolve according to Conway's rules. The application is built using basic HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for implementing the simulation logic.

## How to Use

1. Open the web application in your browser.
2. Toggle cells on or off to set the initial state on the grid.
3. Click the "Start" button to begin the simulation.
4. Watch as the cells evolve based on the rules of the Game of Life.
5. You can pause the simulation at any time by clicking the stop button.
6. To reset the grid just refresh the page .

## Future Enhancements

While this project is a basic implementation of the Game of Life, there are numerous possibilities for enhancements. Some ideas include adding more advanced features like different grid patterns, adjustable simulation speeds, and the ability to save and load specific configurations.

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different initial configurations to observe how the simulation unfolds!
